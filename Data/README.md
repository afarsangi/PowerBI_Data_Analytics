# ðŸ“Š Data Folder Background

This folder contains 2024 data on data job postings scraped from Google.

## Background

The data is from the Power BI course I took, which provides a foundation in analyzing data using this powerful tool. 

You can find the full dataset at [datanerd.tech](https://datanerd.tech).

## Data Files

The datasets used in these projects are a subset of the full dataset for 2024 and come in a variety of forms:

- `job_postings_flat.csv` - A CSV file that contains the data for the job postings in one single table.
- `job_postings_monthly.xlsx` - An Excel file that contains data broken up by months in each sheet.
- `/monthly_files` - A folder that contains the monthly Excel files for the job postings.
- `/star_schema_files` - A folder that contains the star schema files for the job postings.

> **NOTE:** Regardless of the format, all the data is the same. The only difference is the way it is organized.
